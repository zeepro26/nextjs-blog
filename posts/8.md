To begin with, I’d broach that this was an **all-inclusive exercise** that ranged from judging a candidate's technical skills in various aspects,
[For example, Knowledge of CVS systems such as GitHub], the ability to follow technical documentation to implement a product feature, documentation skills, to gauging what a candidate would consider an ideal workday at Vercel.

If I were to improve/alter [and I am nitpicking here] this exercise, I’d introduce a question based on a **real-world customer scenario** and ask the candidate to answer objectively. 

It’d give a fair idea of how an individual approaches the problem, handles customer expectations, identifies and de-escalates a potential escalation/customer dissatisfaction, etc. Along with a candidate's **technical proficiency**, It’d bring their **Customer relationship** skills to the fore.
