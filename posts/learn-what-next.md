In the long term, I am looking to transition into the field of **Product Management** and hence I plan to learn the skills required to be a Product Manager. 

Iâ€™d like to learn how to manage an entire product life cycle right from ideation to testing prototypes, road mapping, performing competition analysis and launching products that customers love.
