In the immediate term, I’d like to quickly ramp up on the **NextJS framework**.
Get my hands dirty by coding and testing out all the key features the framework has to offer.

In due course, I plan to become a **subject matter expert** in a certain area of the product.

In the long term, I am looking to transition into the field of **Product Management** and hence I plan to learn the skills required to be a Product Manager. 

I’d like to learn how to manage an entire product life cycle right from ideation to testing prototypes, road mapping, performing competition analysis, and launching products that customers love.
