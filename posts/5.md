**Problem Description/ How-to**: “How do I do a redirect from “/hello-vercel” to “https://vercel.com”?"

The above functionality can be achieved using the [Redirects](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/redirects/ "Redirects") Feature of [NextJS](https://vercel.com/ "NextJS") . 

**Redirects** allow you to redirect an incoming request path [in our case, “/hello-vercel”] to a different destination path [for instance,  “https://Vercel.com”].

Please follow the below steps to configure the **redirects key** in the file **next.config.js**.
[This file has to be at the root level. i.e. Same directory as the package.json file]

```
module.exports = {
  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/ hello-vercel ',
        destination: ' https://Vercel.com ',
        permanent: true,
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

`redirects()` is an async function that expects an array to be returned holding objects with _source_, _destination_, and _permanent_ properties.

_source_ is the incoming request path pattern.

_destination_ is the path you want to route to.

_permanent_ true or false - if true will use the 308 status code which instructs clients/search engines to cache the redirect forever, if false will use the 307 status code which is temporary and is not cached.

To see “Redirects” in action, run or deploy the [redirects-app](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/redirects/ "redirects-app").

_This example app shows how to use redirects in Next.js to redirect an incoming request path to a different destination path._

Should you have further queries, please feel free to write back. We'd be glad to assist you!
