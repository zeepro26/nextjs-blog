When I hear the terms "lightning talk" and "positive" impact, the below Ted Talk from Guy Kawasaki comes foremost to mind. 

[The art of innovation | Guy Kawasaki | TEDxBerkeley](https://youtu.be/Mtjatz9r-Vc)

It's an old talk [given some time in early 2014] that is relevant even today and presumable will be for a long time to come. 
It's one of those speeches that you can listen to when you arrive at a crossroads in your professional life and are confused about making a decision.
Along with great content, the candor, the suave and the spot-on humor with which Guy Kawasaki puts his message forth are brilliant.

To summarize the talk, I've sharing a few key takeaways below. Although Mr. Kawasaki makes so many nuanced points each of which deserves introspection, the one that resonates most with me is the one in which he propounds the idea that to become [and stay] relevant, how organizations need to learn to jump the curve.

* Make meaning and not only money.
* Have a simple mantra that reflects the value-add your product/service/ offers rather than a lofty mission statement. 
* Innovative products polarize people.
* Fail, but learn from the last failure and keep churning.
* The perfect pitch using the 10-20-30 points rule.).

Be sure to give it a listen! These will be 21 minutes well spent.
